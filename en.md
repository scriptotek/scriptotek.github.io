The Scriptotek (from “scripting” + the Norwegian word for “library”) is an open
community for friendly librarians and their helpers within the Norwegian (Scandinavian?)
library sector, whoever interested in coding to automate everyday tasks,
create or improve services for our users, or what have you.
[Some background in Norwegian](https://www.ub.uio.no/om/organisasjon/prosjekter/scriptotek/).

- **Mailing list**

  [Join](https://sympa.uio.no/ub.uio.no/subscribe/scriptotek) our mailing list
  if you're interested in discussing code projects, upcoming workshops
  (library carpentry) or whatever. The main language for the list is Norwegian, but feel free
  to write in English.

- **Code sharing**

  We love using GitHub for code sharing. You'll find lots of projects on
  [Scriptoteket](https://github.com/scriptotek/), and in addition the BI library
  has their [own site](https://github.com/bisentralen/) with some cool
  Alma and Primo stuff.

- **Workshops**

  During spring 2016 vi arranged [Biblioteksløyd
  beta](https://scriptotek.github.io/2016-03-17-BS/) ([resource page](https://scriptotek.github.io/2016-03-17-BS/slides/)), inspired by
  [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Library
  Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/). We look forward to more
  workshops in the future.

- **Blog**

  [There's a blog](/blog/) too, albeit not often updated. Anything you want to write about?
